      <h1>Genre Defining</h1>
      <p>In 1989 Kentaro Miura created dark fantasy manga, Berserk.
          It is one of the most influential stories ever told. 
          It has inspired many characters, stories, video games, and artists with its fantastic art, complex characters, and storylines.
          It truly is one of a kind.  
          </p>

            My favorite game developer <em>FromSoftware</em> took major ispirations from Miuras work.
            Just like Miura in the world of mangaka, they too created some of the most influential works of art in gaming.
            Commonly known as <em>Soulsborne</em> games, these too were also genre defining.

            Why I love Berserk
          </h2>
          <p>
            Just like Miura in the world of mangaka, they too created some of the most influential works of art in gaming.
            I found Berserk through the Soulsborne games, it was the first manga I had ever read. I've always loved darker series, Berserk was something different.
            It didn't just rely on shock value and gore, though those are huge themes in the story. It was the characters and the scale that really made it some impactful on me.
            A story of a man suffering and struggling through inconcielvale trauma and yet still deciding to press on. I hadn't realized ficition could carry such weight and elicit such emotion from me.
            <img src = "https://i.redd.it/lxiehi0ve8j51.jpg" alt = "Pondering Guts">
            It resonates with me, my life hasn't been easy, yet I still push on. For that reason along with the masterful artistry of the late great Kentaro Miura is why Berserk is my favorite piece of art, ever. 
            And has inspired me to pursue a similiar path of writing and filmmaking.
